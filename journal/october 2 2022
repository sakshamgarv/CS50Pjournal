# 10/2/22 work
"""
1. take input from user
2. the input from user in int form only and must be greater than 0
3. handle exceptions
4. If not integer do while true and reprompt the user for input in int form until given.
5. Generate a random number which is to be guessed in the lvl range
6. the entered integer is the current level.
7. create a range of numbers that can be picked based on the level entered eg: if lvl 100 then a range of numbers between 0-100 can be guessed.
8. If the guessed number in the lvl range is less than the randomly picked number between the lvl, then display guess was too low
9.If the guessed number in the lvl range is greater than the randomly picked number between the lvl, then display guess was too high
10. if number is guessed perfectly say perfect.
11. countinue this loop form steps 7,8,9,10 until we reach perfect number
12. break when all conditions are satisified
