# Learning
## Github
Today I learnt how to set up git on my windows pc
1. I installed git using winget command on windows terminal: `winget install -e --id Git.Git`
2. I created a repository in github called "CS50PJournal"
3. I created a local folder in my windows pc to host this repo
4. Then I configured the git username `git config --global user.name "username_of_user"`
5. Next I configured the git e-mail `git config --global user.email "my_email"`
6. I ran the following commands to intialize remote(local folder) and origin(github repo) 
```
git init
echo "# RepoName" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/sakshamgarv/CS50Pjournal.git
git push -u origin main
```
7. I Configured vs code version control
7.1 I pressed CTRL+SHIFT+P
7.2 selected the `git: clone`
7.3 I authorized vs code version control to gain access to my github account
7.4 Finally i selected the local folder where my remote repo was located
