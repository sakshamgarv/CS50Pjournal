# July 10th 2022
## Tasks done 
- I started with my timetable and started to revise loops
- I watched 35 min of cs50p module 2 for loops and wrote practise code
- I roughly finished 33% of the loop module
`
"""i = 3

while i!=0:

    print("I")
    
    i-=1
    
    """
    

"""

i = 0

while i<3:

    print("I")
    
    i+=1
    
    """
    
tag: not good for big number of loops as you need to list out a lot of numbers in that list

"""
for i in [0,1,2,3,4,5]:

    print("Hi")
    
  """  
  
tag: range function as paramter takes a number to loop the variable


"""

for _ in range(5):

    print("Hello")
    
    """
    
tag: you can do this way by modifying changing default values of sep and end

tag: It is a bit harder for me. I'll use for and while

print("Hi\n"*5,end="")

`
## Timetable checks!
- [x] on july 10th I watched 33% of module 2 loops
- [x] I wrote practise code
### Future goals
- [ ] July 14th to July 21st do practise refer source code and other things
- [ ] July 21st to July 24th do cs50p psets
- [ ] Make youtube videos about python 2 times a week about what I know teaching is the best form learning!
