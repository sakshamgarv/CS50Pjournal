## Tasks done for june 14
- Today I did cs50p problem set [grocery list](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/grocery/)
- Tried to do it but it didn't work we debugged the code and it still didn't work we fixed that later..
- We thought it was a unit testing bug from cs50p but then later found out that they changed the problem and were a bit too **specific**
