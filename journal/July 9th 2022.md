# July 9th 2022
## Tasks done today
- *The diary stopped working as I wasn't able, commit and sync files to vscode and my google drive.*
- *I just thought that vs code is broken and there's no fix.*
- *I got advice to do it online instead of visual studio code.*
- In my opinon, I like this online version than vs code. It's simplicity is nice to work with.
- **vscode will be running my python code only.** 

## Python
1. I will restart python with **4 month schedule, starting on July 10th 2022** 
2. I'll just revise the basic modules 0-2 in *cs50p*
3. Then after these basic modules are revised **I'll watch the lectures and do sample code**
