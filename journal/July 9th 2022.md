# July 9th 2022
## Tasks done today
- The diary stopped working as I wasn't able, commit and sync files to vscode and my google drive
- I just thought that vs code is broken and there's no fix
- I got advice to do it online instead of visual studio code
- In my opinon, I'll use this and vscode will be running my code
- I am going test the online version right now and I hope it doesn't fail. If does I'll keep track of attempts taken to fix it
**Python**
1. I will restart python with 4 month schedule, starting on July 10th 2022 
2. I'll just revise the basic modules 0-2 in cs50p
3. Then after these basic modules are revised I'll watch the lectures and do sample code
