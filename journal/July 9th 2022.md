## Tasks done today
- The diary stopped working as I wasn't able, commit and sync files to vscode and my google drive
- I just thought that vs code is broken and there's no fix
- I got advice to do it online instead of visual studio code
- In my opinon, I'll use this and vscode will be running my code
- I am going test the online version right now and I hope it doesn't fail. If does I'll keep track of attempts taken to fix it
